Prerequisites:
- Python 3.8+
- pip
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., venv)

Installation:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/Ki55n/DataFusion.git
   cd advanced-data-analysis-app

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`

3. Install required packages:
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Download additional resources:
   python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
   python -m nltk.downloader punkt

Configuration:
1. Create a .env file in the project root:
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key_here  (for personal reasons we cannot provide these keys)
   JWT_SECRET_KEY=your_secure_jwt_secret_key_here

2. Set up required directories:
   mkdir uploads processed static visualizations mlruns

Usage:
1. Start the application:
   python app.py

2. Open http://localhost:5000 in your web browser.

3. Upload your data file (CSV, Excel, or TXT).

4. Use the various analysis tools:
   - Data cleaning and transformation
   - Visualization generation
   - Machine learning model training
   - Advanced analytics
   - Custom analysis and report generation

5. Interact with the chat interface for insights and custom analyses.

6. Generate and download PDF reports.

Project Structure:
- app.py: Main application file
- static/: Static files (CSS, JavaScript)
